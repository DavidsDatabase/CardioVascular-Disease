### Project Overview

This project's objective is to provide insights on the different variables that affect the likelihood of having cardiovascular disease. There are numerous variables such as age, weight, cholesterol levels, blood pressure levels and more. By analyzing some KPIs from the dataset, we look to identify any trends, make data-driven recommendations, and hopefully gauge on the different factors pertaining to cardiovascular disease.

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/data>. This dataset has data regarding individuals who has different levels of variables that could lead them to having the disease or not.

### Tools Used

- SQL - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Sorting and Filtering
3. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. Which age groups are more prone to having CVD?
2. Which BMI groups are more prone to having CVD?
3. Which cholesterol level groups are more prone to having CVD?
4. Which blood pressure groups are more prone to having CVD?

### Results/Findings

1. Results show that out of the total 34,979 individuals who has CVD, 17,720 individuals are in their fifties and 10,495 are in their sixties. This could lead to believe that age plays a role in CVD, as the person gets older, the chances of them having CVD increases.
2. Data shows that people who are normal weight and above are prone to getting CVD compared to underweight class individuals. Weight appears to have a big influence for CVD.
3. 23,055 normal cholesterol level individuals have CVD, compared to 6,174 extreme levels of cholesterol and 5,750 high levels of cholesterol. Cholesterol does not seem to have a big impact in whether an individual will have CVD or not.
4. Nearly 31,514 out of 34,979 individuals have hypertension class blood pressure, which is a high stage in blood pressure, have CVD. Blood pressure may have a high causal effect for CVD.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- The big factors for an individual who may be at risk of CVD are age, weight, and blood pressure.
- We recommend any person to be wary of their weight and blood pressure as these factors can be changed. Age cannot be changed. We recommend individuals to take care of their bodies and be healthy.
- However, having CVD does not mean unhealthy. CVD is a broad concept and even a healthy normal weight, normal blood pressure, young age individual can have CVD. 

### Limitations

These initial findings may spark some interest, but further analysis would be needed for more concrete results. For example, this dataset does not provide much information regarding if CVD is a positive or negative outcome. A normal weight, normal blood pressure, at a young age can have CVD. There were clear outliers in this dataset, but we were unsure whether to delete or keep them, but we ultimately kept to avoid skewed calculations.
